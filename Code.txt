Dear All,

As you know, today is my last working day at MS. Even though my internship was only 10 weeks long, it has been a privilege to work here with some of the most talented, warm and friendly team members.

I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all of you for contributing to my growth, both professional and personally. Your guidance and support have truly been invaluable. A special thanks to Tithi for being an amazing mentor and to Preetam for being extremely helpful and supportive.

I wish I could have met all of you in person during this internship, had it not been for the pandemic. Nevertheless, I hope our paths cross again and please do stay in touch on my contact details mentioned below. I wish you all the best!

Thanks.
